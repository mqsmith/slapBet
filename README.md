# slapBet

SlapBet is an interactive sports betting game that allows users to view real time Sports Data and Odds to make "Friendly Wagers" within their Network.


The technologies implemented are JQuery for DOM Manipulation, Bootstrap for styling and Firebase to store User Inputs.  

The Firebase provides a realtime database and backend as a service. The service provides application developers an API that allows application data to be synchronized across clients and stored on Firebase's cloud. The company provides client libraries that enable integration with Android, iOS, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C, Swift and Node.js applications. The database is also accessible through a REST API and bindings for several JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS, React, Ember.js and Backbone.js. The REST API uses the Server-Sent Events protocol, which is an API for creating HTTP connections for receiving push notifications from a server. Developers using the realtime database can secure their data by using the company's server-side-enforced security rules.

2 API's are Used to Import Sports Data
1)Real-Time Sports Data (Games, Start Times, Sporting Info)
MySportsFeeds is one of the Premiere API's on the Web. The BEST source for democratized, crowd-sourced sports data with a real-time API. Real-time and historical data is the information that Fans want to know.

2)Real-Time Game Odds (To Help User make Decision)
The-Odds-Api is used to get Live odds data for loads of sports from the US, UK, and Aussie bookmakers

The API provides real-time odds data for several in-season sports

Football odds data: Aussie Rules (AFL), NFL, College Football (NCAA)
